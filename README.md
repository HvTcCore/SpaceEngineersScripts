# Description 
This is a repository of many niche scripts as well as all of my actively supported workshop scripts.

You are more than welcome to use these scripts in your builds and upload blueprints or worlds that use them; however, I do **not** under any circumstance allow anyone to reupload these scripts themselves to the steam workshop without my explicit permission.

All of my workshop released scripts live in the [Released](Public/Released) folders. These scripts are actively supported and should be generally more efficient than the unpolished scripts that live over in [Unpolished](Public/Unpolished).
